Web Audio Acid Synth

This is a minimalistic (and still in progress) step-sequencer/bassline synthesizer using the Web Audio API. Right it only works properly in Safari and Chrome. Firefox's implementation of the AudioParam.setTargetAtTime() method differs from Chrome and Safari in such a way that Web Acid does not work correctly on Firefox.
