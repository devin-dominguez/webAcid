Web Audio Acid Synth

This is a minimalistic (and still in progress) step-sequencer/bassline synthesizer using the Web Audio API. Right it only works in Safari and Chrome. Firefox's implementation of the AudioParam.setTargetAtTime() method differs from Chrome and Safari in sich a way that Web Acid does not work on Firefox. If you try to run Web Acid in Firefox you will not only hear nothing, but you will get system-wide audio distortion as long as Web Acid is running an for a bit after it closes.

DON'T USE FIREFOX.
